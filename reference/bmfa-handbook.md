# What is the BMFA?

The British Model Flying Association is:

> a non-profit making association of model flying clubs and individuals who agree to join together and pool resources for the benefit of all.

Aircraft designed to compete in the UAS Challenge will inevitably be subject to the same rules and regulations as those that govern model flying. As they share technologies, the best-practice advice given by the BMFA will also be applicable for UAS Challenge competitors. This is imparted in the [BMFA Member's Handbook](http://handbook.bmfa.org/ "BMFA Member&apos;s Handbook").
